                <p class="card-text">Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in
                    Bangalore, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused
                    on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics,
                    fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.
                    The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March
                    2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart has a
                    dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described
                    as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8]</p>
